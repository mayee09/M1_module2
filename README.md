ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It has 32KB internal flash memory and has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-Pin AVR Microcontroller, manufactured by Microchip, follows RISC Architecture and has a flash-type program memory of 32KB. It is the microcontroller, used in basic Arduino boards i.e Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Nano.Servo motors have three terminals - power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to one terminal of ULN2003 IC (10 -16). To protect your Arduino board from damage, you will need some driver IC to do that. Here we have used ULN2003 IC to drive the servo motor. The signal pin is typically yellow or orange and should be connected to Arduino pin number 9.
